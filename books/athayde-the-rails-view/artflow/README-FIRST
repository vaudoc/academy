Rails applications for chapters
===============================

Each directory contains a Rails application for a specific chapter:

 * `css`:         "Adding Cascading Style Sheets"
 * `email`:       "Working with Email"
 * `forms`:       "Building Maintainable Forms"
 * `js`:          "Adding JavaScript"
 * `layout`       "Creating an Application Layout"
 * `performance`: "Optimizing Performance"
 * `presenters`:  "Using Presenters"
 * `readability`: "Improving Readability"
 * `responsive`:  "Handling Mobile Views"

Background
----------

Each application is designed to illustrate the concepts
described in the associated chapter. Some things to note:

 * Authentication, authorization, and model scoping are largely
   stubbed out (or left intentionally missing) so we can focus on the
   view.
 * You may notice files named with a versioning convention, e.g.,
   `file.v1.html.erb`, `file.v2.html.erb`, etc. These files are used in the
   the book to incrementally describe the associated runnable file
   (e.g., `file.html.erb`).
 * While we've made an effort to have the application behave
   consistently across chapters, because the book focuses on the view
   layer (and each chapter is somewhat of a vignette on a specific
   subject) all the changes between chapters may not covered by the
   text.
 * Click around enough, and you're bound to find broken links. While we have
   stubs in place for the larger uncovered features of the
   application, some things are still missing.
 * If you run into problems with the code, please let is know through
   on of the methods listed in the main README-FIRST file for the code download.
  

Application Setup
-----------------

### A Note on Ruby

Each application includes an `.rvmrc` file for use with [RVM][1],
configuring the environment to use Ruby 1.9.3 and a gemset,
`therailsview`. You can [install Ruby 1.9.3 with RVM][2] if you don't
already have it, and the gemset will be created if it doesn't exist.

You don't need to use RVM or a gemset if you prefer. Just keep in mind
the code was built using Ruby 1.9.3; it will probably run on other
1.9.X versions, but is not compatible out-of-the-box, for instance,
with Ruby 1.8.X.

For more information see the Preface in the book text.

### Installing dependencies

To get a chapter application running, first change to that directory
by doing the following (where 'CHAPTER' is the directory for the
chapter, e.g. `layout`):

    cd artflow/CHAPTER

(If you are using RVM, it may prompt you to confirm that you trust the
`.rvmrc` at this point.)

If you haven't installed it yet, you need [Bundler][3]:

    gem install bundler

Install the dependencies for the application:

    bundle install

### Installation Problems

Please report any issues you have installing [on the forum][5].  It's
possible someone has already pointed out a solution.

Here are some known issues:

#### Nokogiri 

If you run into a problem installing Nokogiri, first see the [Nokogiri
installation instructions][4].

Problems have been reported with OSX Lion and Xcode 4. libxml2,
libxslt, and libiconv may need to be installed separately with
Homebrew, MacPorts, or manually.

Once you have the dependencies installed, set up the database.

### Setting up the database

To get the (SQLite3) database set-up and ready to go, we've provided a
single Rake task, `setup`. Do the following:

    rake setup

(If you'd like to use something other than Rails' default of SQLite3,
you'll need to edit the `config/database.yml`, modify the `Gemfile`,
and install those dependencies, as appropriate.)

Next, start the server and view the site:

### Starting the server

Start the server with the `rails` executable:

    rails server

Now point your favorite browser (we recommend Chrome or Firefox) at:

    http://localhost:3000

IMPORTANT: Check the README-FIRST file in the specific chapter
(`artflow/CHAPTER/README-FIRST') for specifics on the URLs to view.
