Code for "The Rails View"
=========================

The code is broken into two major categories:

Rails applications
------------------

These are located in the `artflow/` directory, organized by chapter.

See `artflow/README-FIRST` for pointers to specific chapters and basic
setup information.

Miscellaneous examples
---------------------

The other directories here contain miscellaneous examples that don't fit
into the Rails applications under `artflow/`.  They are also broken up
by chapter:

 * `css`:        "Adding Cascading Style Sheets"
 * `email`:      "Working with Email"
 * `forms`:      "Building Maintainable Forms"
 * `js`:         "Adding JavaScript"
 * `layout`      "Creating an Application Layout"
 * `responsive`: "Handling Mobile Views"
